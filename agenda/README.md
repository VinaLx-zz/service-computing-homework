## Examples

Here are some examples of using Agenda commands.

#### register

Register a new user named "Alice", with password, email address, and phone number.

```shell
./agenda register -u Alice -p 123alice -m www.Alice.com -t 11111111111
```

If you want to register as "Alice" again, you will get:

```
there's another user with username Alice

```

#### login
Login as user "Alice" with password "123alice".

```shell
./agenda login -u Alice -p 123alice
```

If you have logged in and haven't logged out, you will get:

```
Action login requires an logout state
```

If you enter a wrong password or a user which does not exist, you will get:

```
Authentication Fail
```

#### createMeetings
Create a meeting named "ABC_Meeting" as the host, which runs from Nov,1,2017 to Nov,3,2017. And invite "Bob" and "Carlos" as participators. 
```shell
./agenda createMeetings -t ABC_Meeting -p "Bob Carlos" -s 2017-11-01 -e 2017-11-03
```


If succeed, you will get:

```
meeting hosted
```

If the name of meeting has been used, you will get:

```
there's another meeting with title: ABC_Meeting
```

If the time overlaps with some of the participators' schedule, you will get:

```
there are time conflict of some participants
```

If the start time of meeting is set later than end time by mistake, you will get:

```
meeting should end later than start
```

If you enter the time in invalid format, you will get:

```
invalid time format: 2017-11-1
```

#### changeParticipators
Add "David" as a participator of meeting "ABC_Meeting". Notice that user "David" must be registered.

```shell
./agenda changeParticipators -t ABC_Meeting -p David
```

If David is already a participators of this meeting, you will get:

```
user 'David' is already a participant of meeting 'ABC_Meeting'
```

If the meeting does not exist, you will get:

```
meeting doesn't exist: C_Meeting
```

To delete "David" from meeting "ABC_Meeting", you should add "-y" in your command.

```shell
./agenda changeParticipators -t ABC_Meeting -p David -y
```

#### cancel
Cancel the meeting "ABC_Meeting" that is hosted by you.

```shell
./agenda cancel -t ABC_Meeting
```

If you enter a title that does not exist, you will get:

```
meeting doesn't exist: myMeeting
```


#### quit
In this case, we assume that we log in as user "Bob" and as below, "Bob" has been invited to the meeting "ABC_Meeting" hosted by "Alice".

Quit the meeting "ABC_Meeting" of which "Bob" is a participator.

```shell
./agenda quit -t ABC_Meeting
```

If you enter a title but Agenda system finds that you are not a participator of the meeting, you will get:

```
user 'Bob' is not a participant of meeting 'ABC_Meeting'
```

#### list
List all the user that have been registerd.

```shell
./agenda list
```
And you will get their information listed as follow:

```
Username Email Phone
'Alice' 'www.Alice.com' '11111111111'
'Bob' 'www.Bob.com' '22222222222'
'Carlos' 'www.Carlos.com' '33333333333'
'AAA' 'www.AAA.com' '137'
'BBB' 'www.BBB.com' '138'
'CCC' 'www.CCC.com' '139'
```

#### listMeetings
List all the meeting starts later than Oct,1,2017 and ends before Dec,01,2017.

```shell
./agenda listMeetings -s 2017-10-01 -e 2017-12-01

```
And you will get:

```
title: ABC_Meeting
  host: Alice
  time: 2017-11-01 to 2017-11-03
  participants: AAA
```

If the start time of meeting is set later than end time by mistake, you will get:

```
meeting should end later than start
```

If you enter the time in invalid format, you will get:

```
invalid time format: 2017-10-1
```

#### clear
Clear all meetings you attended or created.
Be careful to use this command. All the meetings you host or participate in will be deleted.

```shell
./agenda clear
```

#### delete
Delete your account.
Be careful to use this command. All of the information about you will be erased, and there is no way to get it back.
The meetings you host will be deleted, and you will quit all the meetings you participate in automatically.

```shell
./agenda delete
```

## Implementation Details

The program this time is solely business logic and (almost) no efficiency or programming tricks involved, so language feature and trick doesn't really matters here. The difficulties come down to the logic and hierarchy design of the whole program.

First we provide the overall program structure and then point out some crucial details.

### Overall Structure

On a high level abstraction, the whole program can be separated into four part.

- the entity logic that abstract out the overall invariant of program (package `entity`)
- the program model that implements the basic operations of program (package `model`)
- the logic that pack all basic operations to satisfy all business demand (package `cmd`)
- the (CLI) user interface parsing command line arguments to the action and parameters (package `cli`)

There should be a seperate part for validation for user input parameters and other error handling, but in this case it's combined with the third part due to the time limit of homework.

### Command Line Interface Using Cobra

#### Global argument

```
-h, --help
-d, --debug
```
You can get helpful information whenever you are using Cobar. And you can get detailed log information when using -d.

#### Main Command
We implement the following command for you to use.

```
Available Commands:
  cancel              Cancel your own meeting by specifying title name.
  changeParticipators Change your own meetings' participators.
  clear               Clear all meetings you attended or created.
  createMeetings      Create meetings.
  delete              A brief description of your command
  help                Help about any command
  list                
  listMeetingsCmd     List all of your own meetings during a time interval.
  login               Login
  logout              Logout
  quit                Quit meetings.
  register            Register user.
```

#### register
You can register an account by using `register` command, and we define the following requisite argument. All of them are type of `string`.

```
Flags:
  -m, --mail string       email.
  -p, --password string   Help message for username
  -t, --phone string      Phone
  -u, --user string       Username
```

#### Login
You need to login before you use the most of command in `Agenda`. Once you login, you don't have to login next time, we will keep your state. But you have to log out by yourself in order to protect your privacy. 

```
Flags:
  -p, --password string   Input password
  -u, --user string       Input username
```

#### Logout
No argument is needed here. When you have nothing else to do, you had better log out in order to protect your privacy.

#### delete
We are sorry when you use `delete`. Once you use this command, all of the information about you will be erased, and there is no way for us and you to get it back. So we recommend you not to use it.

#### List
No argument is needed here. You can get all users' information except password so that you can invite others to join your meetings.


#### Create Meetings
After you have login, you can create a meeting by using `createMeetings` command. All of the arguments are required. You should invite at least one participator to join your meeting. After all, you can't have a meeting only with yourself. :P

```
Flags:
  -e, --end string             Input end time as the format of (yyyy-mm-dd).
  -p, --participators string   Input participator name.
  -s, --start string           Input start time as the format of (yyyy-mm-dd).
  -t, --title string           Input title name.
```

#### List Meetings
You can using `listMeetings` to get all of the meetings' information during the specific interval(start - end).

```
Flags:
  -e, --end string     Input the end time.(yyyy-mm-dd)
  -s, --start string   Input the start time.(yyyy-mm-dd)
```

#### Change Participators
Whenever you need to invite or remove the participators of your meetings, you can using `changeParticipators`. But you have to ensure that he or she are available to attend your meeting.

```
Flags:
  -y, --delete                 If true, delete participators, otherwise append participators.
  -p, --participators string   Input the participators.
  -t, --title string           Input the title name.
```

#### Cancel
You may make some mistakes when creating a meeting, then you can just cancel it.

```
Flags:
  -t, --title string   Input the title.
```

#### Quit
You can refuse to attend a meeting by using `quit`, then you can be free to go out for a play.

```
Flags:
  -t, --title string   Input the title.
```

#### clear Meetings
You may feel busy and boring for attending meetings. At that moment, you can use `clear` to cancel all of the meeting which you attended and quit all of the meetings which you are invited. That's you are free!!!


### Entity Logic

We hadle the constraints of meetings and users directly by enforcing the instances of `Users` and `Meetings` to be logically correct. That is, no duplicate users can ever be added into `Users`, and no two meetings whose participants would have overlapped busy time.

So that there's a strong limit on where contraint problem can happen. Also we won't be ever worried about whether users and meetings instances are in a valid state in other contexts, because they always are. This design greatly simplifies the logic implementation other parts program.

### Filesystem Management

Obviously there's a requirement of data persistence of meetings and user record, along with the login state. The management method is not complicated at all, but it still worth a mention.

Just at the program start, agenda checks whether its "home directory"(currently `~/.agenda`) exist, if not, it creates one. And program reads all user and meeting infomation on demand (listing all user do not care any meetings at all and therefore meetings are not loaded in that command). And if anything change during the operation, the new user and meeting infomation rewrites the original ones before program exits.

The serialization and deserialization, as request, are implement directly using the `json` standard library. Nothing strange here. The only thing is that we didn't handle the inconsistency caused by the corruption of storage file, if any unexpected inconsistencies are detected, the program should abort directly with error messages printed.

### Login State

We stored user password in the form of md5 hash, and login file contains the plain username and password. When checking the login state, the password would be checked again in case of the corruption of login file. If the password and hash don't match, the login file is deleted and some operation requiring login state is denied.

### Business Logic

After the implementation of other parts, implementing business logic is straightforward, just doing basic error handling and logic by invoking underlying program model.

I did have some fun here :P
